# Module 1: Spark AI - AI-Powered Testing

## Overview

In this module, we'll explore how to leverage Spark AI for intelligent test generation and maintenance in our e-commerce web application.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of AI-powered testing
- Learn how to integrate Spark AI into your development workflow
- Generate intelligent test cases automatically  
- Maintain and optimize AI-generated tests

## What is Spark AI?

Spark AI is an AI-powered testing framework that helps developers:
- Generate test cases based on application behavior
- Identify edge cases and potential bugs
- Maintain test suites as applications evolve
- Provide intelligent test recommendations

## Getting Started with Spark AI

### Installation

```bash
npm install @spark-ai/testing
```

### Basic Configuration

Create a `spark.config.js` file in your project root:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',
  aiModel: 'gpt-4',
  coverage: {
    threshold: 80
  },
  smartGeneration: true
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Test Generation

Spark AI analyzes your code and generates comprehensive test cases:

```javascript
// Example: AI-generated test for e-commerce cart
describe('Shopping Cart', () => {
  test('should add items with correct pricing', () => {
    // AI-generated test logic
  });
  
  test('should handle quantity updates properly', () => {
    // AI-generated edge case testing
  });
});
```

### 2. Bug Prediction

The AI can predict potential issues before they occur:

```javascript
// Spark AI flags potential issues
// Warning: Potential null pointer exception
// Recommendation: Add null check for user.preferences
```

### 3. Test Maintenance

As your code evolves, Spark AI helps maintain your tests:

```javascript
// Auto-updates tests when API changes are detected
// Suggests new test cases for modified functions
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a single component or feature
2. **Review AI Suggestions**: Always review and validate AI-generated tests
3. **Combine with Manual Testing**: Use AI as a complement, not replacement
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously refine AI suggestions based on feedback

## Exercise

Navigate to `../exercises/exercise-1/` to begin implementing Spark AI in your e-commerce application.
